## Why It’s Interesting
This article highlights that **code generation is the easy part** of AI in software engineering. The harder, more valuable tasks are the *real* engineering work:
- Large-scale **refactors** and **migrations**
- Continuous **testing**, fuzzing, and patching
- Adapting to **unique company codebases** and conventions
- Human–AI **communication** (confidence, clarification, steering)

I found it fascinating because it reframes “AI for code” as much more than autocomplete.  
It’s about building tools that handle **tedious, error-prone engineering work** while surfacing uncertainty so humans stay in control.

## Key Takeaways
- AI should expose its **confidence** and know when to **ask humans for clarification**.
- The authors call for **open-source, community-scale efforts** to tackle these challenges.

## Personal Note
I like how the authors frame AI as an **amplifier for human engineers**, not a replacement.  
By automating the “tedious and terrifying,” AI could free us to focus on creativity, design, and ethics, which is the work only humans can do.
